This example showcases an uncommon error that can arise from the interaction of the try-except-else-finally blocks in Python. The `try` block attempts to perform a calculation that could raise exceptions. The `except` block handles the specific exceptions. The `else` block executes if no exceptions were raised, while the `finally` block always executes, regardless of exceptions. Improper understanding of this control flow might lead to unexpected behavior or overlooked errors. The solution will properly handle and indicate such uncommon scenarios. The detailed explanation will further clarify the uncommon error.
